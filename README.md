# Finding-nuclei-from-images
This project gives an algorithm to automate nucleus detection which will help in speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders.
Basically we have applied image segmentation in the images set to identify the nuclei from the given set of microscopic medical images or masks.
In this project we have made use of U-Net which is a CNN that was developed for biomedical image segmentation.
Various comment lines are included in the ipython notebook for better undestanding of the code used for the project
